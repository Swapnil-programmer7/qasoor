      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Qasoor marks the start of a beautiful chapter in the lives of it's makers.</p>
      <p>3 months ago, in march the Governors of Technology Filmmaking and Photography Society, broke the news that the new members are required to make a movie all by themselves.</p>
      <p>At that time for once everyone doubted their capabilities. We were questioning ourselves and yet in June after having completed the movie, we feel a great sense of joy within us.</p>
      <p>Making this movie was a challenging yet cherishable experience. There were many hurdles sure but with constant help and support of the team members, every difficulty was overcome.</p>
      <p>The team feels elated having completed this amazing feat. Congratulations!!</p>
